            <p>“Self-taught Programming helps you to become an expert in problem-solving as you deal with a lot of hurdles in this journey. It helps you to understand better how things work because you’ve figured it out on your own. In this process, you get to learn various algorithms and methodologies which you may not find from any school or course. Apart from coding, it helps you to develop other related skills as well such as testing, deployment of projects, etc.”</p>
